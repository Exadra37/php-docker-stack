# Php7 Docker Stack

Docker stack to run Php7 Apps in Production and Development, using Docker Compose Services like:

* Http - Nginx, Apache, etc.
* Php7 - Php-Fpm.
* Database - Perconna, MariaDB, Mysql, etc.
* Cache - Redis, MemCached, etc.
* Logger - ElasticSearch.
* Queue - Beenstalkd, RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, Apache Kafka, etc.
* Cron Jobs - Just to schedule cron jobs.
* Dev CLI - Access to the container shell.


Php7 Docker Stack goals is to:

* make possible to have a clean Docker Stack to run Php Apps in any environment.
* be Framework agnostic.
* allow developers without Docker knowledge to use a Docker work-flow in their development environment.


> **NOTE:** Until this package achieves version `1.0.0.0` we should only use it for development, afterwards we should
             use it also for production.

## EXPLICIT VERSIONING

This repository uses [Explicit Versioning](https://gitlab.com/exadra37-versioning/explicit-versioning) schema.


## BRANCHES

Branches are created as demonstrated [here](docs/how-to/create_branches.md).

This are the type of branches we can see at any moment in the repository:

* `master` - issues and milestones branches will be merge here.
* `last-stable-release` - matches the last stable tag created. Useful for automation tools.
* `issue-4_fix-email-validation` (issue-number_title) - each issue will have is own branch for development.
* `milestone-12_add-cache` (milestone-number_title) - all Milestone issues will start, track and merged here.

Only `master` and `last-stable-release` branches will be permanent ones in the repository and all other ones will be
removed once they are merged.
