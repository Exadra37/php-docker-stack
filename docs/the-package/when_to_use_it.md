# WHEN TO USE IT?

Every time you write any Php app or package you should do it based on a Docker work-flow and *Php Docker Stack* is the
way to go.

> **NOTE:** Until this package achieves version `1.0.0.0` we should only use it for development, afterwards we should
             use it also for production.
