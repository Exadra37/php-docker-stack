PHP7 DOCKER STACK

This is a wrapper bash script for `docker-compose` command to run a Docker Stack
for any Php App.


Usage:

    server [wrapper-options] [docker-compose usage here...]


Wrapper Options:

    -h, --help                  Show the wrapper bash script and docker compose help.

    --setup-docker-stack        Runs the setup for the Php Docker Stack.
                                By default is auto invoked on first run.

    --update-docker-images      Will run docker pull for all docker images being used.
                                This is the default behavior on each invocation of server up|run.
                                Will get the latest updates for each docker image.

    --skip-pull-docker-images   When we want to run without pull docker images.
                                Useful also to override the env var IS_TO_PULL_DOCKER_IMAGES.


Examples:

    Brings up all services defined in the `docker-compose.yml`:
        server up

    Brings up all services, but skips pulling docker images:
        server --skip-pull-docker-images up

    Brings up the Http service with all other services it depends on(if in the service definition):
        server up http

    Runs a developer shell to work with the Php Docker Stack:
        server run dev-cli

    Runs a mysql shell to access the Database:
        server run database-cli

    Taking all services down:
        It will destroy all docker containers.
        The data persisted by containers on host is not destroyed.
        Run as:
            server down
